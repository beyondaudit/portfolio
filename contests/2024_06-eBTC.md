# Badger DAO eBTC Zap

## [M-01] Deposit success on Lido is not checked which could lead to unexpected behavior

### Impact

The contract may behave in an unexpected manner

### Proof of concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-badger/blob/main/ebtc-zap-router/src/ZapRouterBase.sol#L38>

When a user tries to open or adjust a CDP using native ETH or WETH, the asset is converted to stETH by being deposited on Lido using the `_depositRawEthIntoLido()` internal function.

Lido has [2 ways](https://etherscan.io/address/0x17144556fd3424edc8fc8a4c940b2d04936d17eb#code) to prevent users from staking their ETH :
1. The contract is paused
2. The stake limit has been reached

If Lido ends up in one of the 2 situations above, all the deposits will essentially revert, whether it is through the use of the `fallback()` function (which eBTC uses) or through the `submit()` function.

In the current implementation, since the low-level call return value is not checked, the contract will revert directly, in an attempt to deposit the assets, which could lead to potential unexpected behaviors in the future.

*in an ideal situation, the transaction will revert later on anyway because the execution flow will try to pull stETH from the router which is not supposed to hold any token*

### Recommended mitigation steps

There are 2 options :

1. Make sure to check the return value of the deposit to Lido in the `_depositRawEthIntoLido()` internal function

```diff
function _depositRawEthIntoLido(uint256 _initialETH) internal returns (uint256) {
    // check before-after balances for 1-wei corner case
    uint256 _balBefore = stEth.balanceOf(address(this));
    // TODO call submit() with a referral?
-   payable(address(stEth)).call{value: _initialETH}("");
+   (bool success,) = payable(address(stEth)).call{value: _initialETH}("");
+   require(success, "Can't stake on Lido");
    uint256 _deposit = stEth.balanceOf(address(this)) - _balBefore;
    return _deposit;
}
```

2. Call the `submit()` function on the stETH contract instead of using its `fallback()` function which will revert in case the deposit fails.
